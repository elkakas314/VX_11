# Copilot Instructions for VX11 (Execution required)

This file delegates to the agent rails at `.github/agents/vx11.agent.md` which are the canonical execution rails for this repository. Always read that file before planning or executing any task.

Requirements:

- Always perform real execution for verification; do NOT produce fake outputs or placeholders.
- Record all executed commands and their outputs into `docs/audit/<TS>/` (see rails for exact filenames).
- Produce a `SCORECARD.json` and `SCORECARD.md` in the same OUT folder after changes.
- Follow the policy: "Only MADRE stays ON" — you may temporarily start other services for checks, but stop them and leave only MADRE running when finished.

Hard rules:

- Never claim to have executed commands if you could not. If a binary or permission is missing, write `BLOCKER_EXECUTION.md` in the OUT folder with the exact reason and stop.
- Evidence must include `commands.txt`, command outputs, diffs for changed files, and any backups.

Control rails location:

- `.github/agents/vx11.agent.md` — read this first and follow the MAP-FIRST → DRY-RUN → APPLY → VERIFY → AUTOFIX → EVIDENCE flow.

If you are unsure, follow the rails and write evidence to `docs/audit/` and create a clear `FINAL_REPORT.md` in the OUT folder.

Prohibited behaviors:

- Do not fabricate test or Docker outputs.
- Do not modify forbidden files: `docker-compose.yml`, `sitecustomize.py`, `tokens.env*`, `.vscode/`, `.devcontainer/`, or `.code-workspace` files except restoring `vx11.code-workspace` when required by rails.

End of instructions.
