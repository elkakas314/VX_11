FASE 0 REAL — STACK DETECTION RESULT
================================================================================

Finding: PYTHON/FastAPI CONFIRMED (NOT Node/Express)

Evidence:
- ✓ requirements.txt exists (FastAPI, uvicorn, pydantic, sqlalchemy, aiosqlite)
- ✓ NO package.json (Node marker absent)
- ✓ main.py files found: 10+ Python entry points (tentaculo_link/, madre/, switch/, etc.)
- ✓ @app.get/@app.post decorators (FastAPI syntax)
- ✗ NO app.get()/ app.post() (Express syntax) found

CONCLUSION: 
The repository IS Python/FastAPI. My earlier auditoría (FASE 0 from 9f60f2c) was CORRECT.

The "improved prompt" user provided was a GENERIC TEMPLATE designed to auto-detect stack.
Since we detected Python, we proceed with PHASE 1 using the Python plan (already documented in PHASE0.5_DECISION_MATRIX.md).

NEXT ACTION:
Implement P0-1 (OFF_BY_POLICY JSON contract) using Python/FastAPI approach.
