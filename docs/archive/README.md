# Archive folder

This folder contains archived files produced by the canonical repo cleanup process.

- Why: archived canonical artifacts (audit, reports) retained for history and traceability.
- Reversibility: no originals are deleted; all archives are copies.
- No deletions: this process does not remove or move ACTIVE files.
