# VX11 Manifestator VSCode Extension

This extension integrates VS Code with the Manifestator service.

Configuration (in VS Code `settings.json` under `vx11Manifestator`):
- `apiUrl`: URL of the manifestator service (default: `http://127.0.0.1:52115`)
- `token`: token to call manifestator (default: `vx11-dev-token-change-in-production`)

This folder was promoted from staging `.tmp_copilot/` and is ready for packaging.
